# File Glob Sort by Regex Capture (v1) — Base Primitive

This is the **base** skill. It scans a directory for files matching a glob
pattern, extracts a sort key from each filename using a regex capture group,
and outputs a deterministic sorted list as JSON Lines. The primitive is
domain-agnostic — any workflow that needs to order files by an embedded
timestamp, sequence number, or other key in the filename can compose this
skill instead of re-implementing the glob+regex+sort pipeline.

The originating use case is sorting webinar recording segments
(`video-<epoch_ms>.webm`) by their embedded Unix millisecond timestamp, but
the same primitive handles log-file date stamps (`app-2026-06-17.log`),
screenshot sequence numbers (`Screenshot 2026-06-17 at 14.30.00.png`),
or any filename pattern with a sortable capture group.

***

## 1. Scope & Intent

- **In scope**: Accept a directory path, a glob pattern, a regex containing at
  least one capture group, and an optional sort-type flag (`int` / `float` /
  `str`). Output one JSON object per matched file, sorted by the extracted key,
  with filename, absolute path, raw key string, key type, size in bytes, and
  POSIX mtime epoch. Support `--reverse` for descending order.
- **Out of scope**:
    - Walking subdirectories recursively (the caller supplies the glob; `**/` in
    the glob produces recursive behaviour if desired, but the skill is
    designed for single-directory scans).
    - Modifying any file (read-only).
    - Converting or interpreting the extracted key beyond sorting (e.g. epoch-ms
    to human-readable date — that is the composer's responsibility).
    - Any filesystem traversal beyond `glob.glob()`.

***

## 2. Environment & Dependencies

### 2.1 Runtime

- **Python 3.12+** — the script uses the standard library only (`argparse`,
  `glob`, `json`, `os`, `re`, `sys`). No external PyPI packages. Verify:

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

No other tools required.

### 2.2 Verification

```bash
python3 -c 'import sys; assert sys.version_info >= (3,12), "Python 3.12+ required"; print("OK")'
```

***

## 3. CLI Contract

Located at [`scripts/sort-by-capture.py`](./scripts/sort-by-capture.py).

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/file-glob-sort-by-regex-capture/scripts/sort-by-capture.py \
    --directory "/path/to/dir" \
    --glob "video-*.webm" \
    --regex "video-(\d+)" \
    [--sort-type int] \
    [--reverse]
```

### 3.1 Arguments

| Argument | Required | Default | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--directory` | Yes | — | Directory to scan. Resolved to an absolute path. |
| `--glob` | Yes | — | Glob pattern (e.g. `video-*.webm`, `*.log`, `Screenshot *.png`). |
| `--regex` | Yes | — | Python regex with at least one capture group `(...)`. Must match the expected portion of each filename. |
| `--sort-type` | No | `int` | How to interpret the captured string for sorting: `int`, `float`, or `str`. |
| `--reverse` | No | — | If set, sort descending (largest key first). |

### 3.2 Output Format

One JSON object per line (JSON Lines / NDJSON), sorted by key. Each object contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `filename` | string | Bare filename (no path). |
| `abspath` | string | Absolute filesystem path. |
| `key` | string | Raw captured string from the regex capture group. |
| `key_type` | string | Sort type used (`int`, `float`, or `str`). |
| `size_bytes` | integer | File size in bytes. |
| `mtime_epoch` | integer | Last modification time as Unix epoch seconds. |

Example output:

```json
{"filename": "video-1780724440748.webm", "abspath": "/path/video-1780724440748.webm", "key": "1780724440748", "key_type": "int", "size_bytes": 18874368, "mtime_epoch": 1756780800}
{"filename": "video-1780724540587.webm", "abspath": "/path/video-1780724540587.webm", "key": "1780724540587", "key_type": "int", "size_bytes": 84934656, "mtime_epoch": 1756780800}
```

### 3.3 Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Success — JSON Lines written to stdout. |
| 1 | Error — directory not found, no files matched, or regex failed to capture on all files. Diagnostic printed to stderr. |

## 4. Protocol

### 4.1 Step 1 — Verify Environment

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 4.2 Step 2 — Run the Script

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/file-glob-sort-by-regex-capture/scripts/sort-by-capture.py \
    --directory "/path/to/dir" \
    --glob "video-*.webm" \
    --regex "video-(\d+)"
```

### 4.3 Step 3 — Consume Output

Pipe the JSON Lines output into a consuming script or redirect to a file:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/file-glob-sort-by-regex-capture/scripts/sort-by-capture.py \
    --directory "/path/to/dir" \
    --glob "video-*.webm" \
    --regex "video-(\d+)" \
    > /tmp/sorted-files.jsonl

# Parse with Python
python3 - << 'PY'
import json, sys
with open("/tmp/sorted-files.jsonl") as f:
    for line in f:
        entry = json.loads(line)
        print(entry["filename"], entry["key"], entry["size_bytes"])
PY
```

## 5. Edge Cases & Constraints

- **No files match the glob**: The script prints an error to stderr and exits 1.
- **Regex does not match a file's basename**: That file is skipped with a
  warning on stderr. If no file matches, the script exits 1.
- **Multiple capture groups**: Only the first capture group (`group(1)`) is
  used as the sort key. Additional groups are ignored.
- **Non-numeric key with `--sort-type int`**: Python's `int()` conversion
  raises `ValueError`, which propagates as an unhandled exception. Use
  `--sort-type str` for non-numeric keys.
- **Very large directories**: `glob.glob()` returns all matches in memory.
  For directories with >100 000 matching files, consider a streaming approach
  (this skill targets typical media/project directories with dozens to
  thousands of files).

***

## 6. Prohibited Actions

- The Agent MUST NOT re-implement the glob+regex+sort pipeline inline when
  this skill is available. The script is the SSOT.
- The Agent MUST NOT modify files discovered by this skill — it is a read-only
  operation.
- The Agent MUST NOT use this skill for recursive directory traversal unless
  the glob explicitly contains `**/` — the caller controls the scope via the
  glob pattern.

***

## 7. Script Reference

[`scripts/sort-by-capture.py`](./scripts/sort-by-capture.py) performs:

1. Resolve `--directory` to an absolute path; validate it exists.
2. Build the full glob pattern (`<directory>/<glob>`) and run `glob.glob()`.
3. For each file, extract `re.search(regex, basename).group(1)`.
4. Build a list of dicts with filename, abspath, key, size_bytes, mtime_epoch.
5. Sort by key converted to `--sort-type` (int / float / str).
6. Write one JSON object per line to stdout.

***

## 8. Composition by Higher-Level Skills

| Composer Skill | Composition Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`media-timestamp-summary`](../media-timestamp-summary/SKILL.md) | Calls this base script with `--glob "video-*.webm" --regex "video-(\d+)"` and `--sort-type int` to obtain chronologically-sorted webinar recording segments, then consumes the JSON Lines to generate a human-readable summary file with date conversions and time-gap analysis. |
| [`onedrive-flat-folder-split-by-size`](../onedrive-flat-folder-split-by-size/SKILL.md) | Calls this base script with `--glob "Screenshot *.png"` / `--glob "Screen Recording *.mov"` and a date-extraction regex to obtain JSON Lines of OneDrive-synced files sorted by embedded date key. Consumes the JSONL stdout and pipes into `json-group-stats` and `json-batch-file-move` via the composer script. |

New composers (e.g. log-file date-range report, screenshot sequence auditor,
archive-by-timestamp organizer, flat-folder date-based organizer) MUST reuse
this base script rather than re-implementing the glob+regex+sort pipeline.
Composer scripts MUST resolve this base script via a relative path anchored to
their own location, per the
[Layered Composition Mandate](../../../ai-agent-rules/ai-rule-standardization-rules.md).
