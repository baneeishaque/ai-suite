# OpenCode Session Write Extractor — Companion Bridge

## Purpose

This file is the companion bridge for non-skill-aware agent runtimes.
The operational SSOT lives in [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md).

## When This Skill Applies

- You have an opencode session export (`.md` format) containing tool calls
- You need to extract `Tool: write` JSON payloads (`filePath` + `content`) from that session
- The target file(s) to recover are specified via glob pattern
- You want a domain-agnostic primitive — not specific to any particular file

## Operational Procedure

Read [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) for the full operational procedure, including
all mandates, scripts, and verification steps. Do NOT execute any step
without first loading `SKILL.md` — this bridge is intentionally
non-actionable.
