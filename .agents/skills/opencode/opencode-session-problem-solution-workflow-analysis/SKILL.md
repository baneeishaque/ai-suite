# OpenCode Session Problem-Solution-Workflow Analysis (v1)

## Composition Rationale

This skill is a **composer**: it does NOT re-implement YAML parsing or
transcript extraction. It orchestrates one base skill:

1. **[`opencode-session-yaml-transcript-extractor`](../opencode-session-yaml-transcript-extractor/SKILL.md)** —
   invoked FIRST. The composer shells out to its
   `scripts/extract-yaml-transcript.py --input <session> --truncate <N>`
   via subprocess (path anchored on the composer script's own location,
   `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`), and consumes the stdout JSONL
   (session_header / user_text / thinking / tool_call records) at its step 1.

The composer's domain-specific value-add over the base alone: the
reconstruction procedure itself — reading the problem out of the user's
messages (incl. correction turns), locating the accepted solution, and
classifying tool sequences into accepted vs rejected paths — plus the
deterministic markdown report skeleton (session meta, per-turn chronology,
summary table) emitted by `scripts/reconstruct-workflow.py`.

Inlining the transcript parse here would duplicate logic that any other
session-analysis composer (summarization, debugging forensics, fidelity
scans) also consumes.

Bidirectional discoverability: the base lists this composer in its
`## Composition by Higher-Level Skills` table.

## 1. Environment & Dependencies

| Requirement | Minimum | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.11+ (3.12 recommended) | `python3 --version` |
| Base skill installed | present | the composer exits 4 with a clear error if `opencode-session-yaml-transcript-extractor/scripts/extract-yaml-transcript.py` is missing |

The composer script is stdlib-only (`json`, `subprocess`, `argparse`,
`pathlib`, `datetime`, `sys`). The base skill brings the PyYAML
dependency — see its Environment & Dependencies section.

## 2. Operational Logic

### 2.1 The 7-step analysis procedure (Zero Omission)

1. **Locate the session's log files** — `.opencode/logs/ses_<id>/` per-turn
   directory (`000-header-*.yaml` + `NNN-<timestamp>.yaml`; filename order
   IS chronological) or the monolithic `ses_<id>.yaml`. Both layouts are
   accepted by `--input`.
2. **Extract the transcript** — run the base
   `extract-yaml-transcript.py` (via the composer script, or directly):
   one JSONL record per narrative element with global `index` and `turn`.
3. **Render the deterministic skeleton** — run
   `scripts/reconstruct-workflow.py --input <session> --output <report.md>`:
   session meta (id/title when present), `## 3. Workflow Executed` per-turn
   chronology (user text, thinking, tool calls with truncated args/results),
   per-turn tool-call summary table.
4. **Identify the Problem** (judgement) — read the user's textual messages:
   the FIRST message states the original ask; correction turns
   ("no, this is wrong", "yes - got it") mark rejected vs accepted states.
   Quote the exact user text that defines the problem.
5. **Identify the Solution** (judgement) — the state/answer the user
   ultimately accepts. Cite the concrete evidence path that produced it
   (DB key, file path, CLI command, output record).
6. **Classify the workflow** (judgement over the skeleton) — mark each
   tool-call prefix as accepted path or rejected/alternative path, using the
   thinking text and the correction turns as the boundary signal.
7. **Synthesize** — fill `## 1. Problem`, `## 2. Solution`,
   `## 4. Rejected / Alternative Paths`, `## 5. Final State` in the report;
   the `## 3. Workflow Executed` section is already deterministic.

### 2.2 Judgement guidance

- **Correction turns are the strongest signal**: a user message beginning
  with "no", "wrong", or restating the ask ("i want open editors. also all
  my editor tabs are pinned.") closes the previous attempt and re-opens the
  problem. The turn immediately AFTER the last correction carries the
  accepted direction.
- **The solution must be evidenced**: record the exact artifact that
  produced it (e.g. `state.vscdb` key `memento/workbench.parts.editor` →
  `editorpart.state.serializedGrid`, `sticky: N` = pinned count) — a
  solution without a path is an assertion, not an answer.
- **Rejected paths precede the correction**: a rejected path is a tool-call
  prefix that the thinking text abandons ("doesn't expose", "not persisted",
  "rejected path") or that a correction turn overrides.
- **Bound output size**: always pass `--truncate` (default 500) — full
  args/results must never be dumped to scrollback; the complete fidelity
  lives in the JSONL, not the report.

***

## 3. Scripts

- [`scripts/reconstruct-workflow.py`](scripts/reconstruct-workflow.py) —
  Tier-1 Python CLI (stdlib): subprocesses the base extractor, builds the
  report skeleton.

### CLI Contract (Stable)

```bash
python3 scripts/reconstruct-workflow.py --input <yaml-file|dir> \
    [--truncate <N>] [--output <report.md>]
```

| Flag | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--input` | Yes | Monolithic `.yaml` file OR per-turn session directory |
| `--truncate` | No | Truncate text/args/result to N chars (default 500) |
| `--output` | No | Write the report to file instead of stdout |

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success — report generated |
| 2 | Base extraction failed (parse error, no records) |
| 3 | Input path not found |
| 4 | Base skill script missing |

### Output Contract

The report is a markdown skeleton: session meta blockquote, `## 1. Problem`,
`## 2. Solution`, `## 3. Workflow Executed` (deterministic per-turn
chronology + summary table), `## 4. Rejected / Alternative Paths`,
`## 5. Final State`. The TBD placeholder blocks are the agent-judgement
sections to be filled per §2.1 steps 4–7.

## 4. Traceability

- Origin: session `ses_012fd48f0ffedPT1brWW8fcezW` (2026-08-11) — created
  after the analysis of `ses_02f0d4351ffeTl1vcyqbPXZqvW` ("Listing absolute
  paths of open VSCode files") demonstrated the undocumented
  problem → solution → workflow reconstruction procedure; the composer
  script generalizes the ad-hoc `/tmp` summarizer + narrative dumper used
  during that analysis.
- Created 2026-08-11
